# Summary
My main goal is to become a Frontend Developer. At this moment I don’t have any IT experience, but I have a great desire to become a part of IT-community. I’m fond of code writing and doing JS tasks (especially when I get it right), going for a walk with my dogs and traveling in warm countries.
